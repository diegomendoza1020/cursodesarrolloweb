    <p> <span class="mayuscula">W</span>olf Alice are one of the most beloved bands in the country. A couple of impressive early EPs saw them flirt with different genres and establish themselves as a ferocious live force, which meant 2015 debut album <span class="span"> My Love Is Cool</span> had a lot of hype to live up to, and the four-piece – vocalist Ellie Rowsell, guitarist Joff Oddie, bassist Theo Ellis and drummer Joel Amey – smashed every expectation laid at their door. It was nominated for the <span class="span">Mercury Prize</span> and saw them sell out three back-to-back shows at London’s Kentish Town Forum. The follow-up, 2017’s <span class="span">‘Visions Of A Life’</span>, changed things up again as the band got bolder, the venues got bigger, and this time around they deservedly <span class="span">won that Mercury Prize. </span> </p>

    <p> <span class="mayuscula">W</span>olf Alice formed in 2010, when singer/songwriter Ellie Rowsell and guitarist Joff Oddie began playing as an acoustic duo and took their name from a short story by Angela Carter. After issuing a self-titled EP, the group expanded into a quartet with the addition of drummer Joel Amey and bassist Theo Ellis.  </p>

Wolf Alice's official debut EP, <span class="span">Blush</span> , appeared that October and garnered positive reviews, with some critics comparing the group to Elastica, Garbage, the Duke Spirit, and Pixies. The following year, they signed to Dirty Hit and issued their second EP <span class="span">Creature Songs</span>  in May. A pair of singles, <span class="span">"Giant Peach"</span>  and a reworked version of "Bros", preceded Wolf Alice's June 2015 debut album <span class="span">My Love Is Cool</span> . Recorded in London's Livingston Recording Studios with producer Mike Crossley, the album debuted at number two on the U.K. Albums Chart, was <span class="span">certified gold</span> in the band's homeland, and was nominated for the Mercury Prize as well as for Brit and Ivor Novello awards   </p></div>
