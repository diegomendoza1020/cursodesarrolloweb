    <p> <span class="mayuscula">W</span>olf Alice are one of the most beloved bands in the country. A couple of impressive early EPs saw them flirt with different genres and establish themselves as a ferocious live force, which meant 2015 debut album <span class="span"> My Love Is Cool</span> had a lot of hype to live up to, and the four-piece – vocalist Ellie Rowsell, guitarist Joff Oddie, bassist Theo Ellis and drummer Joel Amey – smashed every expectation laid at their door. It was nominated for the <span class="span">Mercury Prize</span> and saw them sell out three back-to-back shows at London’s Kentish Town Forum. The follow-up, 2017’s <span class="span">‘Visions Of A Life’</span>, changed things up again as the band got bolder, the venues got bigger, and this time around they deservedly <span class="span">won that Mercury Prize. </span> </p>
