        <p> The debut full-length released June 22 2015 on Dirty Hit Records, it was produced by Mike Crossey. <br> <br> The band described the record as a “mix of genres” with singer Ellie Rowsell telling NME that “It’s 100 percent not a grunge record. It’s a much braver record than that”. Rowsell added: “We’ve been making sounds that don’t necessarily sound like guitar and experimenting with the way we use our voices. We’ve tried to match the emotion of the songs in how they’re performed and recorded,  tried to make a sad song really feel and sound sad.” <br> <br> The four-piece’s first work has sold over 60,000 copies, it was certified Silver by BPI and it gained a Mercury Prize nomination.</p>

<p>You can join us if you think you're wild</p>
<p>You can join us if you're a feral child</p>
<p>Our love is cool</p>

<p>I hate to see it despair, oh, don't you do it</p>
<p>I hate to see it screw up</p>
<p>But it knows I can hardly grieve</p>
<p>When it's hard to give a, hard to give a... (*scream*)</p>

<p>What the hell keeps me here?</p>
